MongoDB is a NoSQL database designed for flexibility and scalability. Unlike traditional relational databases, it stores data in JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents, allowing for dynamic schemas. This structure makes it ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, enabling faster development and easier scaling. MongoDB supports powerful querying, indexing, and aggregation features, making it a preferred choice for applications requiring high performance, such as real-time analytics, content management systems, and cloud-based applications.
